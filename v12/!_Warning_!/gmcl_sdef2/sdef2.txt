gmcl_sdef2 - Garry's Mod SE1 bypass + source




I'm leaving GMod for good. Have one of my old ScriptEnforcer bypasses + source.

The dll goes in ./lua/includes/modules and the lua file in ./lua/menu_plugins/ (create this folder if it doesn't exist).

No commands/settings. Add these by editing ml_SDef2.lua if you want. Allows all lua files to load by default.
