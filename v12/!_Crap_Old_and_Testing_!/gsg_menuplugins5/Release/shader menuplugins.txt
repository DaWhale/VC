load as shader dll, engine loads this before lua_shared

start a thread, loadlibrary lua_shard then loop trying to get ILuaShared

when got, get interfaces for ICVar, IVEngineClient then exit that thread and start a 2nd one

thread 2 will try to get the ILuaInterface of the menu

when got, exit this thread too and use IVEngineClient to run the cvar to RunString the whatever (can't use ILuaInterface's, crashes)
